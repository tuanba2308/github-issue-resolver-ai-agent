# N8N Nodes for GitHub Issue Resolver AI Agent

## GitHub-Related Nodes:
1. GitHub Trigger Node
   - Automatically start workflows on GitHub events
   - Supports issue creation, update, comment events

2. GitHub Node
   - Create/update issues
   - Add labels
   - Assign users
   - Close/reopen issues

## AI Classification Nodes:
1. OpenAI Node
   - Text classification
   - Sentiment analysis
   - Issue categorization

2. Langchain Agent Node
   - Advanced AI workflow management
   - Can replace custom classifier agent

3. HTTP Request Node
   - Flexible integration with any AI API
   - Can call custom classification endpoints

## Workflow Management Nodes:
1. Webhook Node
   - Receive external events
   - Trigger workflows

2. Merge Node
   - Combine data from multiple sources
   - Handle complex workflow logic

3. Set Node
   - Transform and prepare data
   - Add metadata to issues

## Monitoring and Logging:
1. Prometheus Node
   - Export metrics
   - Track workflow executions

2. Slack/Discord Notification Nodes
   - Send alerts
   - Report workflow status

## Recommended Workflow Components:
1. GitHub Trigger → OpenAI Classification → GitHub Update
2. Webhook → AI Agent → Issue Management
3. GitHub Issue → Langchain Agent → PR Generation

## Comprehensive Workflow Mapping

### Workflow JSON Structure
```json

    {
      "parameters": {
        "events": ["issues", "pull_request"]
      },
      "type": "n8n-nodes-base.githubTrigger",
      "position": [0, 0]
    },
    {
      "parameters": {
        "operation": "AI Classification"
      },

          }
        ]
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Workflow Deployment Considerations

### Key Workflow Steps:
1. GitHub Webhook Trigger
2. Validate Webhook Signature
3. Classify Issue with AI
4. Determine Workflow Path
5. Execute Specialized Agents
6. Update GitHub Issue/PR
7. Store Workflow Memory
8. Log Metrics

### Deployment Architecture:
- Use Docker Compose for deployment
- Configure environment variables
- Set up SSL certificates
- Implement rate limiting
- Configure error handling and alerting

## Integration Strategies

### AI Classification
- Leverage OpenAI or Langchain nodes
- Implement multi-step classification
- Support various issue types (bug, feature, documentation)

### GitHub Automation
- Automate issue lifecycle management
- Trigger actions based on issue classification
- Generate pull requests for resolved issues

### Performance Optimization
- Implement caching with Redis node
- Use parallel execution for independent tasks
- Manage task dependencies

### Security Measures
- Webhook signature verification
- API token management
- Code execution sanitization

## Workflow Customization Options
- Mix AI, code, and human steps
- Add approval workflows
- Implement safety checks
- Configure role-based access

## Monitoring and Observability
- Export metrics to Prometheus
- Log workflow executions
- Track performance and error rates
- Send notifications for critical events

## Best Practices
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Implement proper error handling
- Regularly update and maintain workflows
- Test workflows thoroughly before production deployment
